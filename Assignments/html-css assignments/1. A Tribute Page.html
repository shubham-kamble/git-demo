                <br>Inventor Nikola Tesla was born in July of 1856, in what is now Croatia. He came to the United States in 1884 and briefly worked with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. He sold several patent rights, including those to his alternating-current machinery, to George Westinghouse. His 1891 invention, the "Tesla coil," is still used in radio technology today. Tesla died in New York City on January 7, 1943.
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Alternating current:</b> In his rivalry with Thomas A. Edison, Tesla invented the electric motor, theorized and promoted the use of alternating current electric power and demonstrated it could be used safely.</li>
                    <li><b>Hydropower:</b> George Westinghouse used Tesla's patents to create hydroelectric power generation at Niagara Falls.</li>
                    <li><b>Radio and television:</b> In 1891 Tesla invented a transformer for the production of high frequency and high voltage electricity. The Tesla coil is used in every radio and television.</li>
                    <li><b>Remote control:</b> He won a patent dealing with the remote control by radio of moving vessels and vehicles, laying the groundwork for wireless telemechanics, robotics and satellite communication. </li>
                    <li><b>Radar:</b> The people who built the first primitive RADAR units in 1934 were following principals, mainly regarding frequency and power level, that were first established by Tesla in 1917.</li>
                    <li><b>X-rays:</b> German physicist Willhelm RÃ¶ntgen is credited widely with the discovery of X-rays in 1895, but Tesla's own experiments highlighted some of the inherent dangers of using radiation on human flesh. </li>
                    <li><b>Robotics:</b> Tesla imagined that, in the future, a race of robots would be able to perform labor safely and effectively. </li>
                    <li><b>Tesla Coil:</b> Developed in 1891, the Tesla coil was used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity. Tesla used this device in different configurations to conduct innovative experiments in his development of many other inventions.</li>
